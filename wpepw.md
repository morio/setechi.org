## Idea
This project is to accelerate education in what we deem as the "third world".
To start this project 10 Universities placed in the 10 worst educated countries. With the aim to provide a full education to a random but guided set of children in the country. It will teach from preschool to PhD. All will learn at their own pace. They may drop out at anytime but the school will provide full medical, psychological, and security for these students. Drop outs will be taken seriously and a full review of the failure of the school will be taken, steps to mediate future drop outs will be considered and implemented. The child will also be allowed to rejoin the school if he or she wishes.

Education will be taught in English for the sake of donated textbooks from English speaking schools and the prevalence in the STEM PhD programs.
Native languages will be taught to all students and they are encouraged to use them to keep fluency. 

Hopefully lectures and professors from other first world countries will donate their time teach a year or two but a continued flow is not expected. Therefore video live or recorded will be used.

The hope is students will become teachers and professors once they graduate or go off to first world universities to teach and share their life stories. The last hope is other become skilled employees in their own country and help build sustainable power and food systems that they might skip the industrial pollution so common with growing countries. 

Of course the school will have an advance PhD Letters and Arts program. The history, art and culture should be recorded and developed.

Much hope is put on these children but the hope is the school does not pressure them in the scholastic achievement.

The School will be a boarding school, designed professionally but hopefully built locally. Many educational field trip will be take to explore their country and teach them of their own culture as a nation. 

Families are welcome to come visit and some maybe end up working as staff if possible.

The school will be build with an amnesty from the county and it may not interfere with the school. 

If the school is successful and the country meets certain Amnesty International Human Rights goals the school will be completely passed the nations government with the native board members full approval.
WPEPW will then dissassociate itself from the school.
